            <br>
            <p>When the German automaker introduced the second generation of this four-door coupe on the market in 2009, it was an important step forward, although the car came during the world financial crisis, and that affected the brand's sales. Still,  by 2014, those numbers climbed back. Also, in 2014, the European Union started to switch from Euro 5 emission standards to Euro 6. As a result, not just Mercedes-Benz but all automakers had to upgrade their vehicles. The CLS 63 AMG couldn't make an exception, and the automaker used the moment to implement several other improvements to this four-door coupe.

                The most striking change was noticed at the front, where the AMG received a diamond-pattern grille, which replaced the simple black one used on its predecessor. Mercedes-Benz also upgraded the headlights with the Multibeam LED technology and made them better for night driving situations. <br> Furthermore, the automaker also changed the front bumper, <br> which incorporated the A-shaped lower grille and the massive side scoops covered with a chicken-wire style mesh. From its profile, the 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG featured the same V8 biturbo chromed badges on the front fenders, behind the wheel arches. At the back, the automaker installed an upgraded bumper that featured a set of thin vertical vents on the outer corners, while underneath it, the CLS kept the same four rectangular exhausts as its predecessor. From its profile, the CLS 63 AMG featured a set of 19” light-alloy wheels fitted with 255/35 tires up front and 285/30 tires to the rear axle. <br>
                
                Inside, the most significant change was for the infotainment unit. The automaker replaced the formerly used small color display neatly integrated into the dashboard with an 8” landscape-oriented screen mounted into a free-floating position. Even though it looked like an aftermarket piece of equipment, it was all original and was controlled by the same <br>rotary dial housed on the center console behind the gear selector. Like its predecessor, the 2014 CLS63 AMG featured high-bolstered bucket seats for the front passengers and a bench profiled for two in the back, separated by a center console fitted with cup holders.
                
                Under the hood, the automaker kept the same 5.5-liter V8 powerplant, helped by two turbochargers. In the AMG 63 clothing, it offered 550 HP, while the AMG 63 S 4Matic version added another 27 ponies to the pack. In addition, the latter version was offered with an all-wheel-drive system. Both versions sent their power via an AMG Speedshift MCT 7-speed <br>automatic (multi-clutch) gearbox. For better handling, the automaker tuned the suspension and added a negative camber for the front axle. Moreover, Mercedes-Benz also enlarged the front axle's track by 24 millimeters (0.95”).</p>
