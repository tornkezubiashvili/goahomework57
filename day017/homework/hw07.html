    <h1>E60 M5</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Produced between 2004 and 2010, BMW once again introduced an equally impactful car in the form of the BMW M5 E60, which was, and still is,
         like nothing anyone had seen before. Taking the base 5 Series model at the time,
          BMW took this platform and created the most jaw-dropping and most powerful sedan on the market. Even in today's performance sedan market,
           the '04 BMW M5 E60 can comfortably compete with the very best in its class. Here are 10 things that everyone should know about the groundbreaking
            fourth-generation BMW M5.</p>
            <p>Easily the standout feature of the '04 M5 E60 is the mighty V-10 engine under the hood,
                 which at the time was the most powerful engine to ever feature in a sedan. Managing to produce 500 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque,
                  there truly wasn't anything else like it on the market.

                At the time of the car's production, BMW was heavily involved in Formula 1,
                 with BMW-Sauber being a pretty competitive and successful team during the early 2000s. Considering the success they were seeing,
                  it was a given that road cars would be inspired by their team racing at the pinnacle of motorsport.</p>
                  <p>Rated at 500 horsepower (unlocked in M-Mode), it was the most powerful engine ever fitted into a sedan.
                    The S85 V-10 engine was specifically designed for this car.
                    It was heavily inspired by Formula 1 engines of its time, being designed to maintain high revs with a maximum of 8,8250 RPM.
                    11 gearbox modes
                    Two engine power modes
                    Three throttle response modes
                    Three suspension settings
                    Two steering modes
                    Three DSC positions</p>
                    <p>2004 was one of the standout years of the sport's V-10 era, which lasted from 1998 to 2005,
                         with BMW being a team that produced one of the best V-10 engines out of them all. These engines were designed to be high-revving,
                          something which was applied to the S85 V-10 that was introduced with the M5 E60, allowing the car to reach a maximum of 8,250 RPM.
                           A unique Double VANOS variable valve system was also introduced for the '04 M5 E60 to further
                            assist the engine in achieving its impressive numbers.</p>
                            <p>BMW as a manufacturer is known for its history of inline-six engines, along with its usage of V-8s and V-12s from time to time.
                                 The V-10 engine, however, has only been used in BMW's fleet twice. The M5 E60 was the first BMW car to feature a V-10,
                                  followed two years later by the BMW M6 E63. The major difference between these two cars is the M6 is 
                                  a two-door coupe instead of a sedan, but both cars share the same S85 V-10 engine under the hood.</p>
                                  <h2>Most Notable Features and Information</h2>
                                  <br>
                                  <p>The M6 manages to produce 507 horsepower against the M5's 500 horsepower,
                                     but it doesn't have a massive difference in the car's overall performance compared to the M5. 
                                     These two cars both have a uniquely special place in BMW's illustrious legacy, 
                                     still being renowned and desired by so many enthusiasts around the world. 
                                     The M5 does have the M6's number in terms of practicality, with the four doors expectedly
                                      providing ample amounts of interior space.</p>
