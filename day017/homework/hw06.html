    <h2>Mercedes-AMG GT 43 Coupe 2024 - Present</h2>
    <h3>Mercedes-AMG introduced a new base model for its GT lineup in 2024 for the 2025 model year
         when it unveiled the 43 Coupe version of this lineup by installing an inline-four turbocharged engine in the car’s hood.</h3>
         <p>The Affalterbach-based company considered downsizing a bit when it introduced the GT 43 Coupe version in its lineup. To do that,
             it took the hand-built four-banger designed for the A 45 S and dropped it inside the engine bay of a GT.
              While the match looked unusual for a brand that used to have a punchy turbocharged V12 powerplant,
               it was actually a good thing for the automaker. The end result was a vehicle capable enough to outrun many sportscars on the market.
                Furthermore, it wasn’t difficult to create the vehicle since it already had the engine, the transmission, and the platform already developed.

            Mercedes-AMG tried to differentiate the look of its lower-priced 43 Coupe from its higher-powered siblings,
             such as the GT 55 or the 63 versions. As a result, the coupe had a new front fascia that featured a Panamericana-style grille,
              like its brothers, but a different apron. Instead of side-mounted slim vertical scoops,
               it sported a broad lower air intake flanked by the air intakes that cooled the front brakes. Still,
                the automaker fitted the vehicle with the same headlights featuring three LED lines as daytime running lights.
            
            The automaker designed new front fenders for the GT 43 Coupe. These featured horizontal vents behind the wheel arches. 
            Moving on to the sides, the automaker offered an option for black side sills included. Both front and rear fenders were narrower
             than on the rest of the range. Still, the overall look of the vehicle retained the main characteristics of a grand tourer: a long hood,
              a short greenhouse, and a sloped back. The car rode on 19-inch alloy wheels, with an option for a 20- or 21-inch set. 
              An EASY PACK tailgate that included a hands-free operated tailgate was available. Out back,
               the GT 43 featured an integrated rear spoiler that could raise and lower depending on the car’s needs.
                It was part of an active aerodynamic package that also included a set of flaps hidden behind the front grille.
                 Out back, Mercedes-AMG fitted the 2025 GT 43 with two twin exhausts that flanked an active diffuser.
            
            Inside, the coupe boasted a 2+2 configuration, with sports seats wrapped in Nappa leather at the front and a bench seat for two in the back.
             As an option, customers could get the vehicle with AMG Performance seats with integrated headrests and higher bolstered areas.
              Fronting the driver was a digital instrument panel integrated into a three-dimensional visor. The center console housed an 11.9-inch
               touchscreen installed in portrait mode, featuring an MBUX infotainment system. It offered extensive AMG-specific content in five display styles.
            
            Mercedes-AMG installed an inline-four turbocharged powerplant carried over from the A 45 S model. Despite its two-liter displacement,
             this unit provided 421 PS (416 hp) to the rear wheels via a SPEEDSHIFT 9-speed automatic transmission with a wet-clutch system.
              A belt-driven starter generator provided an additional 10 kW (13 hp) for a short period of time. As a result,
               the 43 Coupe could rocket from 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) in 4.6 seconds on its way to a top speed of 174 mph (280 kph).</p>
