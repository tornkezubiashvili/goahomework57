<p>The new E 55 AMG:

  Supercharged AMG V8 engine develops 350 kW/476 hp
  AIRMATIC DC air suspension tuned to AMG specifications
  AMG SPEEDSHIFT with Formula 1-style steering wheel operation
  18-inch AMG twin-spoke wheels, dynamic AMG bodystyling
  AMG sports seats with exclusive nappa/nubuk leather trim
  New voice-controlled COMAND system celebrates world premiere
  The new E 55 AMG represents the latest chapter in the illustrious history of supercharged Mercedes-Benz cars.
    
  An era that began in the late 1920s with the legendary supercharged Mercedes-Benz S to SSKL models enjoys its most exalted moment yet in the shape of the new sports Saloon.
    
  With the latest E 55 AMG, Mercedes-AMG has created a worthy successor to the popular outgoing model, of which some 12,000 units rolled off the production line between 1997 and 2001.
    
  This makes the outgoing E 55 AMG the most successful AMG model in the company’s 35-year history.
    
  The might of the AMG supercharged V8 engine with 5.5-l displacement, the Formula 1-style steering-wheel-mounted gearshift buttons,
  the AIRMATIC DC air suspension tuned to AMG specifications and a full complement of equipment – including AMG 18-inch twin-spoke wheels, 
  AMG bodystyling and nappa/nubuk leather upholstery – together enable the new E 55 AMG to present an unrivalled package and take a leading position ahead of the other standard sports saloons in its segment.
