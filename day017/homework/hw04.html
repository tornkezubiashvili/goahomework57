   <p>Mercedes’ stylish coupe-style mid-size sedan, the CLS, survived for two generations only and was never replaced after MY2018 as sedans
     fell out of favor with buyers,who are increasingly buying crossovers and SUVs. For the 2007-2018 model years, the Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 carried
      the flag as the quickest and most powerful CLS you could buy, dispensing massive performance via thundering V8 engines,
       first a naturally aspirated 6.2L and later a twin-turbocharged 5.5L V8. The last one was sold in 2017 and there will never be another,
        though AMG’s V8 powertrain lives on in other Mercedes models.</p>
        <br>
   <p>After the original was on the market for five model years, the W218 redesign of the Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 hit the market as a 2012 model,
     now with a new engine - a twin-turbocharged 5.5L V8 with 518 hp in the regular 63 or 550 hp with the Performance Pack specified. For MY2014,
      the regular 63 got the 550-hp engine and a new S model debuted with 577 hp, as the Performance Pack was discontinued,
       while 4Matic AWD became standard on both.</p>
        <br>
    <p>For its first generations, the CLS in 2006 was called the CLS 55 AMG and used a 469-hp supercharged 5.4L V8 engine,
         but the first of the Mercedes-AMG CLS 63 generations was launched a year later with a naturally aspirated 507-hp 6.2L V8, RWD,
          and a seven-speed automatic transmission. For the 2009 model year, Mercedes-AMG made changes to the CLS 63 in terms of equipment and styling,
           but not to its powertrain.</p>
