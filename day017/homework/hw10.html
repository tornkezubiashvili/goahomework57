    <p>Seat time. That’s what I was thinking as I mashed the pedal in the F10 M5 I was driving. Believe it or not, I had never sat inside,
         let alone drive one. Like ships in the night, we always seem to miss each other. Too busy on shoots at the Performance Center.
          Owners with schedules that didn’t sync up with mine. I’ve had the title of this article in my head for years, 
          and maybe that’s why it’s been so hard to test one. Have we forgotten about this M5 already?</p>
          <br>
          <p>The 2015 BMW M5 quick take
            <br>
            Get one:
            <br>
            Gimme that sweet, sweet V-8. Comfortable at 10 mph or 100. The personification of all that BMW M should be.
            <br>           
            Don’t get one:
            <br>
            Too quiet. Some cheap bits inside. Steering makes long-distance calls to the tires. DCT is no ZF.
            <br>            
            Soul Score: 8
            <br>
            A sweet spot for modern BMW M cars. Fast, capable, comfortable, and fun.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It might surprise you, but the legend of BMW M did not start with the number 3. BMW’s smaller M offering wasn’t even available in size four-door.
                 No, if you wanted a fast sedan, it had to be the E28 M5.
                Over the years, the M5 has been able to hold its own in the lineup. Chassis codes like E34 or E39 should bring back warm fuzzies.
                 But the F10 M5 is different. It’s the first turbocharged M5, replacing a legendary V-10. It had grown in size,
                  making it much less of a hoon machine, and much more like a really fast 7 Series. And its looks, while beautiful to behold, 
                  weren’t meant to draw attention to itself. It was the ultimate Q car</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Performance Score: 8. Refined racing</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>One way that time adjusts our perception is through Clarkson’s old friends of speed and power. When the F10 M5 came out, wow.
                     560 horses. A DCT (maybe a manual if you’re really lucky). A 0-60 time of 3.7 seconds. Yet here we are 10 years later, 
                     and it’s made the car seem…normal? Pedestrian? The F90 is a second faster to 60. You feel it. But dismiss this car’s performance so easily,
                      and you’ll miss the point of it.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>It’s the S63! This glorious V-8 debuted in the X5 M, but BMW updated it when the F10 came out, and the result was the S63TU.
                         This was the first M engine to receive Valvetronic valve timing, and along with 22 lbs of twin-turbo boost,
                          helped give the F10 M5 560 horses and 500 lb-ft of torque. Though this example was missing it,
                           Competition-equipped cars could be had with 575 horsies. Doubt you’ll miss it, like in every other Competition-vs-base debate.</p>
                           <br>
                           <p>What makes the engine work here is that you can actually use it. Put the car in Sport+, and it gives you the typically wonderful
                             throttle response M engines are known for. The F10 weighs 4,300 lbs, which is about the same a the F90, but with less power,
                              the car needs a bit more prodding to pull itself out of corners.
                              <br>
                            This makes the F10 M5 fun. More fun than any sedan this luxurious has any right to be. Keep your foot in it and acceleration will 
                            become violent as you rush toward the redline (peak power is at 5,000–6,000 rpm), but this isn’t an inline-6. 
                            You can’t really fall off boost and feel sluggish.
                            <br>                            
                            The only thing I can knock here is the sound. The exhaust is muted, distant. Dare I say it doesn’t even sound like a V-8.
                             If you get one, set aside some money for an aftermarket exhaust.</p>
