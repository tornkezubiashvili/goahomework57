    <p>Back in 2007, Mercedes model nomenclatures still corresponded more or less with the size of the engine under the hood, 
        and so it was with the first of the Mercedes-AMG C63 Sedan generations, which had a 451-hp 6.2L V8 under the hood. 
        There were year-on-year changes to the Mercedes-AMG C63 Sedan, including a new seven-speed automated manual transmission for MY2012.
         The W204 Mercedes-AMG C63 underwent a redesign for the 2014 model year, with the C63’s charismatic naturally aspirated 6.2L V8 discontinued
          in favor of a twin-turbocharged 4.0L V8, still dubbed the C63, and now with 469 hp.
           The fifth-generation redesign of the Mercedes-AMG C63 sedan from model years 2024 did away with V8s altogether;
            the C63 is now a hybridized 2.0L turbo-four with 671 hp.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The redesigned W206 is the first of the Mercedes-AMG C63 Sedan generations to have only turbocharged 2.0L four-cylinder engines across the board,
                 culminating in the hybridized C63 E Performance with 671 hp and 752 lb-ft of torque.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>To prepare it for its last three years on sale, the W205 received a mild facelift, but the C63 powertrain remained untouched.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>The operatic naturally aspirated 6.2L V8 didn’t survive the transition to the W205 and was replaced with
                     a twin-turbocharged 4.0L V8 with 469 hp (503 hp in the S). It remained in use in the previous-generation coupe.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>he original C63 Sedan came with a naturally aspirated 6.2L V8 with 451 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque.
                         The urge was sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed automatic transmission that could be manually
                          overridden and came with various shift modes.</p>
