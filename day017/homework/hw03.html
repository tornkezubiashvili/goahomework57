   <p>Founded by former Mercedes engineers, Erhard Melcher and Hans Werner, AMG is the legendary performance division of Mercedes-Benz,
    credited for creating some of the most iconic vehicles to date, including the 1999 SL 73 which featured a V-12 engine, the E 55, and the GT R. 
    Among the top groundbreaking models to exit AMGâ€™s Affalterbach factory is the W124, better known as the Hammer,
    A Mercedes-Benz W124 series sedan modified by arguably the most advanced technicians and engineers of the era.
    <br>
    The founders of AMG had a dream of creating a sedan that could achieve 300-kMh (186 MPH) and saw their vision begin to 
    manifest in late 1984 when the Mercedes-Benz W124 made leaps and bounds in terms of automotive design and quality.
    Featuring state-of-the-art multi-link suspension and the most aerodynamic design of the time,
    AMG promptly began working on a V-8 conversion of the W124. The result was a vehicle that would set the precedent for future super sedans, 
    as well as spearhead the entire movement.</p>
